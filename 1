  <h1 style="color:#7D0303""><u>What is bullying?</u></h1>
  <p>There are two kinds of bullying people can go though. Bullying is an ongoing and deliberate misuse of power in a relationship [friend or family or lover] through repeated verbal, physical, and/or social behavior which intends to cause physical, social, and/or psychological harm.</p>
  <p>School bullying is another kind of bullying and is defind as unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. This behavior is repeated or it has the potenetial to be repeated over time. Both kids who are being bullied and those who are doing the bullying may end up with serious lasting problems</p>
 <h3>My Opnion: This is some what true for the most part but is also bullshit. Bullying is bullying it does not matter if it comes from a child, friend, family member, or a lover in a relationship. BULLYING IS BULLYING no matter the age.</h3>
  <h1  style="color:#7D0303"><u>My Life When Bullied</u></h1>
<h2>Elementry School</h2>
<ul>
  <li>My voice</li>
  <li>Getting my period when I was half way to three-quarters of the way through my third grade year.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Junior High School</h2>
  <li>Having my head literally bashed into the desk I was sitting at during math class in seventh grade then ending up being the one who was sent outside even though I did nothing wrong.</li>
  <li>In eigth grade one day while I was walking home I was picked up [hand on back of neck and on back] and literally thrown to the ground. I was just inches from hitting my head on the concrete. When my dad came to get her off me since she was heading to where I was to do who knows what, he pulled her back and two security guards yelled at him saying he was not allowed to handle other students so we both went to the principle. She basically said I was to blame for all that happened to me, that I did something to cuase all these problems I was having......[Can you say BULLSHIT!!]. Because of her poor judgement and lack of wanting to deal and take responsibility my dad was almost arrested and all for trying to stop her from attacking me.</li>
  <h2>High School</h2>
  <li>Having some of my stuff being stolen from my locker and just like all other school years little friends. Though I did have a few more friends then I did my past school years.</li>
